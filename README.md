# Classifier-Comparison
Introduction:
In this project, you will implement and compare the performance of three classification models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. The goal is to predict individuals' income based on given features. You will use a dataset containing information about individuals, and the dataset consists of 32,561 samples with two classes, 'Income' and other feature columns.

Implementation:

Utilize pre-built machine learning models from the sklearn library.
Preprocess the dataset by handling null values, converting categorical data using techniques like Label Encoding and One-hot Encoding, and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as normalization and standardization if needed.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the models on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.
Compare the performance of the models and analyze the results.
Optionally, you can fine-tune hyperparameters for improved model performance.
Conclusion:
In the conclusion, provide insights into the choice of encoding methods and preprocessing steps, discuss the reasons for these choices, and analyze the performance of each model. Explain the rationale behind hyperparameter tuning decisions if applied.
